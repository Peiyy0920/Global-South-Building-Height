# 🌍 Global-South-Building-Height
A curated dataset of estimated building heights across urban areas in the Global South, generated by publicly available Digital Orthophoto Maps (DOMs), ICESat-2 ATL03 photon data, and open geospatial footprints. This repository provides high-resolution, multi-temporal height maps to support research in urban morphology, informal settlement monitoring, climate vulnerability assessment, and sustainable development planning.
